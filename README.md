# Petra Build Autotools

This repository contains scripts for building the Autotools required for building the Petra source code. The Autotools include the m4, autoconf, automake, and libtool packages.

## Requirements

These scripts require sudo permissions to run. It is recommended to choose an arbitrary directory under `/usr/local` for the installation path. For example, you could use `/usr/local/petra_build_autotools`.

## Post-Installation Steps

After running the script, you must add the printed environment variables to the **.bash_profile** of the account where you will be building the Petra source code. Then, you must apply the changes.
